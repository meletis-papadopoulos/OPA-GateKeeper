Create an OPA GateKeeper policy (create a constraint template and a constraint) that checks for the following:
     1. Does the Deployment or StatefulSet have a HPA?
          If yes, validate that the minimum HPA replica is greater than 1
     2. If the HPA replica is equal to 1, block the Deployment or StatefulSet with the following message:
          "Given the application is set to scale, for higher environments you must set HPA minimum replica to be greater than 1."
     3. If no HPA is present, issue a warning stating the following message: 
          "There is no HPA present. For higher environment usage, please consider adding one."
