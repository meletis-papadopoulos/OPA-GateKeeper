### Ticket Description ###

Create an OPA GateKeeper policy (constraint template and constraint) that checks for the following:
     a. Does a Deployment or StatefulSet have a HPA? If yes, validate that the minimum HPA replica is greater than 1.
     b. If the HPA replica is equal to 1, block the Deployment or StatefulSet with the following message: "Given the application is set to scale, for higher environments you must set HPA minimum replica to be greater than 1."
     c. If no HPA is present, issue a warning stating the following:"There is no HPA present. For higher environment usage, please consider adding one."
