Create a GateKeeper policy that checks for:
Does the deployment/sts have a HPA?
If yes, validate the minimum is greater than 1
If set to 1, block the deployment/sts with message
Given the application is set to scale, for higher environments you must set HPA minimum replica to greater than 1
If no HPA is present output a warning stating
There is not HPA present for higher environment usage, please consider adding one
